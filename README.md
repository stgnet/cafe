CAFE Honor Sheet
================

Description
-----------
This application provides a convenient online method of recording
"Honor Sheet" cafe transactions that were previously done on paper.

This software was written for the [Digium Beans & Bytes Cafe](http://www.digium.com/en/company/cafe)
by [Scott Griepentrog](http://github.com/stgnet) in October of 2014 after
the failure of the Cafe's cash register combined with the replacement
(Square) not having support for purchasing on account.  The code is
open sourced on github.com: [http://github.com/stgnet/cafe](http://github.com/stgnet/cafe)

Menu
----
The menu of items for purchase is displayed by default.  This list
is generated automatically from the list of items in the database.

Purchase
--------
Select Purchase from the menu to start recording a transaction.  First
enter your email address, then in one of the Item rows start typing the
name of the item you are purchasing and a list of matching items will
be displayed.  Select the item to populate the price.  If the item to
be purchased is not found, enter a description and the price manually.

Account
-------
Choose Account from the menu to see your current balance and items that
have been purchased.

Admin
-----
Cafe operators can record a payment, view a report of account balances,
and edit the menu items.
